# Extension Manager for Pelican Panel

This repository provides a modified version of specific files from the Pelican Panel (version 1.0.0-beta19) to add an Extension Manager feature.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Early Development Stage**  
This project is in an early stage and more a proof of concept than actual "software". Features are limited and subject to change.  New functionality will be added over time.

## Notes

-   This repository only includes modified files; the full Pelican Panel is **not** redistributed.
    
-   Only tested with version `1.0.0-beta19`.
    
-   Use at your own risk. Test in a non-production environment before deployment.
    
-   Contributions, issues, and pull requests are welcome.
